I'm a former conference interpreter and translator who taught herself HTML, CSS and Python before joining Makers Academy. I'm currently looking for a software engineering role in a company that values individuality and variety to develop my skills further.

## Skills

#### Problem solving
  To reduce repetitive manual work and streamline working process I initiated two projects while working in Yoox Net-A-Porter's Product Editorial team:  

  - Size & Fit translation generator:
    SiFi works with a VLOOKUP formula. For each sentence entered in the tool, it scans the English list in the required Database and provides the corresponding translation instantly.

  - Audit crawler:
    Audit crawler extracts complete structured data from Net-A-Porter's Designer Landing Page and store the Product No., English Product Description and Chinese Product Description in a CSV file to be used in auditing. Previously, team members need to manually copy & paste.

#### Project management
  I'm experienced in turning big but vague ideas to action plans by breaking them down to small steps. I have initiated, planned and executed several projects both in The Lingoes and Yoox Net-A-Porter——streamlined the localisation workflow and increased the team's productivity.

  During this time, I also gained valuable experience in getting buy-in from the team, managing and directing team members working on a project while, at the same time, ensuring that team members are happy, motivated and productive.

#### Quick Learner
  Since I started learning coding, I have always been picking up new technologies quickly. As someone who have never heard of massively multiuser online game, I went on to create one with my teammates within a week: [MMOG](https://github.com/Xin00163/mmog).

  I also attended a one-day React Native course at CodeBar and worked a Snapchat app clone: https://github.com/Xin00163/SnapApp.


#### Communication
  As an simultaneous and consecutive English-Chinese interpreter I’ve been in a huge range of situations, conversing with so many different people on all sorts of topics. This experience has enabled me to develop strong communication and interpersonal skills.
