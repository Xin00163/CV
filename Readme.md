I'm a former professional conference Interpreter and Translator who taught herself HTML, CSS and Python before joining Makers Academy. I'm currently looking for a software engineering role in a company that values individuality and variety to develop my skills further.

## Skills

#### Software engineering
I am passionate about writing easy-to-understand, clean code that can be built on later. My experience lies mainly in Object-oriented programming languages: Python and Ruby. I've also created projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OAuth, SQL and Google APP Engine.

#### Project management
I'm highly experienced in turning grand but vague ideas to action plans. I have initiated, planed and executed several projects both in the Lingoes and Yoox Net-A-Porter——streamlined the localisation workflow and increased the team's productivity.

During this time, I also gained valuable experience in getting buy-in from the team, managing and directing team members to work on a project, at the same time, ensuring that team members are happy, motivated and productive.

#### Problem solving
To reduce repetitive manual work and streamline working process, I initiated two projects while working in the Product Editorial team:  

- Size & Fit translation generator:

  SiFi works with a VLOOKUP formula. For each sentence entered in the tool, it scans the English list in the required Database and provides the corresponding translation instantly.

- Audit crawler:

  Audit crawler extracts complete structured data from Net-A-Porter's Designer Landing Page and store the Product No., English Product Description and Chinese Product Description in a CSV file to be used in auditing. Previously, team members need to manually copy & paste.

#### Fast learner
Learning is an ongoing objective for a simultaneous/consecutive interpreter, so I constantly feed my mind new information, whether it be current political events or nuclear topics that you know little about. Being an interpreter also put me in various situations, conversing with different people regarding all sorts of topics, which make me a quick learner and also cultivate my curiosity for things beyond your realm of knowledge.

#### Additional skills

   - Methodologies : Agile, Test Driven Development
   - Design: Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator
   - Language: Chinese
