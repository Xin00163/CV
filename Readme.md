I'm a former translator and project manager who taught herself HTML, CSS and Python before joining Makers Academy. I'm currently looking for a software engineering role in a company that values individuality and variety to develop my skills further.

## Skills

#### Software engineering
I am passionate about writing easy-to-understand, clean code that can be built on later. My experience lies mainly in Object-oriented programming languages: Python and Ruby. I've also created projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OAuth, SQL and Google APP Engine.

#### Project management
I'm highly experienced in turning grand but vague ideas to action plans. I have initiated, planed and executed several projects since joining the team——streamlined the localisation workflow and increased productivity of the team.

I also gained valuable experience in getting buy-in from the team, managing and directing team members to work on a project, at the same time, ensuring that team members are happy, motivated and productive.

#### Problem solving
To reduce repetitive manual work and streamline working process, I initiated two projects while working in the Product Editorial team:  

- Size & Fit translation generator: SiFi
  SiFi works with a VLOOKUP formula. For each sentence entered in the tool, it scans the English list in the required Database and provides the corresponding translation instantly

- Audit crawler
  Audit crawler extracts complete structured data from Net-A-Porter's Designer Landing Page and store the Product No., English Product Description and Chinese Product Description in a CSV file to be used in auditing. Previously, team members need to manually copy & paste.
