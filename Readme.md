I'm a former fashion subeditor and project manager who taught herself basic HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python before joining Makers Academy. I'm currently looking for a software engineering role in a company that values individuality and variety to develop my skills further.

## Skills

#### Problem solving
  To reduce repetitive manual work and streamline working processes, I created two projects while working in Yoox Net-A-Porter's Product Editorial team:  

  - Size & Fit translation generator:
    SiFi works with a VLOOKUP formula. For each sentence entered in the tool, it scans the English list in the required Database and provides the corresponding translation instantly.

  - Audit crawler:
    Audit crawler extracts complete structured data from Net-A-Porter's Designer Landing Page and store the Product No., English Product Description and Chinese Product Description in a CSV file to be used in auditing. Previously, team members need to manually copy and paste.

#### Project management
  I initiated, planned and executed several projects both in The Lingoes and Yoox Net-A-Porter, which streamlined the localisation workflow and increased the team's productivity.

  In my final project, I introduced Trello to the team to help manage our daily tasks. It helped us to both break down the tasks into small steps and also improved our productivity.

#### Quick learner
  Since I started learning coding, I have always been picking up new technologies quickly. As someone who is not familiar with massively multiplayer online game (MMOG), I went on to create one with my teammates within a week: [mmog](https://github.com/Xin00163/mmog).

  I also attended a one-day React Native course at codebar and worked on a [Snapchat](https://github.com/Xin00163/SnapApp) app clone.


#### Communication
  I believe effective communication is really important for group work. When working on a group project, I had two team members not talking to each other, which led to them both doing the same thing. As a result, I suggested having stand-ups every day and switching roles after lunch break. This helped us to clear any misunderstandings about who is doing what and we never faced the same problem again.

  For our final project, I proposed the idea of using a learning diary to keep record of what we did everyday so that everybody would be on the same page. This also helped other people to understand our development process.
